# About {.unnumbered .unlisted}

I am a bioinformatician and software engineer with expertise in creating data infrastructures, developing scientific software, and applying advanced computational methods to complex biological problems. I began programming at 15 and have since developed a strong foundation in life sciences and computational methods, this has culminated in a rewarding academic and professional career.

I love to learn and work on personal projects. I am a polyglot; native in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, and Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ I am also fluent in Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ and I speak Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º. My personal interests range from combat sports to high-performance robotics and hardware.
