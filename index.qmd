My expertise spans from high-performance computing to genomic data analysis, allowing me to tackle multifaceted challenges in both academic and industry settings.


## Showcase

### [Dereck's Notes](https://www.derecksnotes.com)

Dereck's Notes[^1] is a knowledge distribution platform, scientific dictionary, and blog I created for myself. It is now in its 4th iteration (v4.0). This project demonstrates my expertise in web development, **both front end and back end**, as well as content creation:

TypeScript is used throughout the project. The frontend is built with Next.js 14, React, and MDX. The backend is powered by Express, Mongoose, and Redis, with Multer and Bcrypt for file uploads and password security, respectively.

The whole is deployed via CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Docker.

### [dmplot](https://github.com/dereckmezquita/dmplot)

I originally became interested in algorithmic trading and financial data analysis while working on my dissertation. I developed the `dmplot` package to facilitate the analysis of financial and time series data. `dmplot` is an R framework written in high-performance C++ and `ggplot2` for financial and data analysis in general.

- High-performance C++ functions for data processing
- `ggplot2` custom layers
- `R6` classes for stateful data processing and plotting

It is a condensation of my knowledge accumulated in data science, software engineering, and financial analysis. The package provides R6 classes for easy data processing and plotting, algorithms, functions, and `ggplot2` layers for comprehensive financial data analysis.

## Research and Publications

My research is characterised by the application of bioinformatics, statistics and high-performance computing to solve complex scientific problems. Some fields I have worked on include rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, and studies on genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics.
